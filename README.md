# Inventory System
This is an inventory system I made in Unity for a school project. I made this entire system with help from tutorials online. Unfortunately I can't share the entire project, because I don't have permission from the rest of my team to share the entire project.

This inventory uses custom events to handle mouse clicks and drags. With this inventory system you can pickup items and those items will be added into the inventory. The items are scriptable objects where you can set the max amount of items can be in one stack. In the inventory you can move the item(s) to a different slot in the inventory, you can also drag those items in the hotbar at the bottom. Whith this system you can easily implement new items and a use for the items when they are used through the hotbar.

You are not allowed to use these scripts without my written permission.
